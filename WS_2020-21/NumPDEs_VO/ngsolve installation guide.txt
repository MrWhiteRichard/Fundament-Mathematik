Windows:

NGSolve:
Follow the instructions in the following link PRECISELY
"https://ngsolve.org/downloads"

Jupyter-Notebook:

pip install IPykernel

execute the commands in the following link
"https://ngsolve.org/docu/latest/install/usejupyter.html"

Also run these commands:

pip install ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension install --user --py widgetsnbextension
jupyter nbextension enable --user --py widgetsnbextension
jupyter nbextension install --user --py ngsolve
jupyter nbextension enable --user --py ngsolve

If "jupyter" is not recognised as a command in the command line, add it (the folder path of your "jupyter.exe") to your environment variables.
The same goes (more or less for python and pip.)

You should also consider pip-installing the following packages:
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install scipy
pip install sympy

Attention:
Do NOT use virtual environments!
