\section{Introduction}

Wigner's theorem has it's motivation in physics. It plays a role in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. In this paper we proof, in comparison to other papers I found, a rather general form of Wigner's theorem. As already mentioned in the abstract, most of the ideas in this paper are from \cite{spiegel2018constructive} and there are no completely new ideas. This can be put down to the fact that the present paper is a seminar paper, which implies that this paper was written with the intention of practicing the writing process and not so much with the intention to present new results. Nevertheless the paper might be interesting especially for less experienced mathematicians, because everything is presented in great detail. Furthermore the paper comprises some additional ideas from \cite{Geh_r_2014} or \cite{Bargmann_1964}.
