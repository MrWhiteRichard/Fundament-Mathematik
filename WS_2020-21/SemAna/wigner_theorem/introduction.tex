\section{Introduction}

Wigner's theorem has its motivation in physics. It plays a role in the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. In this paper we proof a rather general form of Wigner's theorem. As already mentioned in the abstract most of the ideas in this paper were taken from \cite{spiegel2018constructive}. The present paper is a seminar paper. Therefore, it was written with the intention of practicing the writing process and not with the intention to present new results. Nevertheless the paper might be interesting, especially for less experienced mathematicians, because everything is presented in great detail. Furthermore the paper comprises some additional ideas from \cite{Geh_r_2014} or \cite{Bargmann_1964}.
