  abstract =     "\ldots{} As long as there is a path from the source
                 (start node) to the sink (end node), with available
                 capacity on all edges in the path, we send flow along
                 one of these paths. Then we find another path, \& so
                 on. A path with available capacity is called an
                 augmenting path. \ldots{} -- wikip [08].
