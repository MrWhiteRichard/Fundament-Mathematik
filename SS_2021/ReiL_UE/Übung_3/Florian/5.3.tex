\begin{exercise}[\hl{Exercise 6.9: Implementation Task - Windy Gridworld with King's Moves}]

Re-solve the windy gridworld assuming eight possible actions, including
the diagonal moves, rather than the usual four. How much better can you
do with the extra actions? Can you do even better by including a ninth
action that causes no movement at all other then that caused by the wind?
