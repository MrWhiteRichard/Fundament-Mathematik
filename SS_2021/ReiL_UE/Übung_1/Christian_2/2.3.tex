\begin{exercise}
Suppose you treated pole-balancing as an episodic task but also used discounting, with all rewards zero except for $-1$ upon failure.
What then would the return be at each time?
How does this return differ from that in the discounted, continuing formulation of this task?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The terminal state of the episode would always be the state where we fail to balance the pole, so we would always get reward $0$ an get exactly one reward of $-1$. All in all we would get

\begin{align*}
  G_t
  =
  \sum_{k=t+1}^T \gamma^{k-t-1} R_k
  =
  -\gamma^{T-t-1}
\end{align*}

In the discounted, continuing formulation where we fail at steps $T_1, T_2, \dots > t$ we would get

\begin{align*}
  G_t
  =
  -\sum_{j = 1}^\infty \gamma^{T_j - t - 1}
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
