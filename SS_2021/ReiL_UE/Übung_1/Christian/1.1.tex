\begin{exercise}
Exercise 2.1 In $\epsilon-$greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and $\epsilon = 0.5$, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
The greedy action is selected either when we take the greedy action (with probability 0.5) or when we do exploration but still take the greedy action (since we take an arbitrary action while doing exploration).
So the probability that the greedy action is selected is

\begin{align*}
  0.5 +0.5\cdot 0.5
  =
  0.75
\end{align*}
\end{solution}
