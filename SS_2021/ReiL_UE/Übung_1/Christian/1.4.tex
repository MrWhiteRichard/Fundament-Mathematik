\begin{exercise}
Implement a simple bandit algorithm for the \blockquote{$10$ armed-testbed}.
(Ten independent bandits whose action value $a_i$ is taken from a normal distribution with mean $0$ and variance $1$ for $i \in \Bbraces{1, 2, \dots, 10}$; the distribution of each reward should be defined from a normal distribution with mean $a_i$ and varience $1$)

Repeat the experiment $1000$ time steps and average over $1000$ independent runs for at least $3$ different epsilon values and plot the results.
