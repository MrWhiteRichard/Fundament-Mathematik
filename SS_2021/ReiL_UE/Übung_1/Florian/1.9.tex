\begin{exercise}[Exercise 3.6]

Suppose you treated pole-balancing as an episodic task but also used discounting,
with all rewards zero except for -1 upon failure. What then would be the return
be at each time? How does this return differ from that in the discounted, continuing
formulation of this task?

\end{exercise}

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

\begin{solution}

Let $T$ denote the time of failure, i.e. the end of the episode.
Then at every time step $k$ the discounted return is given by $-\gamma^{T-k-1}$.

In the discounted, continuing formulation the discounted return would need to
include all future instances of failure.
Therefore the discounted return at time step $k$ would look like this:
\begin{align*}
  G_k = \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} -\gamma^{T_i -k-1},
\end{align*}
whereas $T_i$ denote the time steps, where the pole falls over.

\end{solution}
