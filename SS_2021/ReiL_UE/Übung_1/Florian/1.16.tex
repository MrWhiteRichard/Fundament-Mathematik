\begin{exercise}[Exercise 3.16]

Now consider adding a constant $c$ to all the rewards in an episodic task, such
as maze running. Would this have any effect, or would it leave the task unchanged
as in the continuing task above? Why or why not? Give an example.

\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}

With the same calculations as before, we can see that this doesn't affect relative state values,
since it just adds $c\cdot T$ to the value of all states (assuming no discounting).

However, now we have to account for different episode lengths.
In the example of the maze task, where we gave a reward of -1 for every time step
in which the agent has not escaped the maze; if we now increase all rewards by +1,
the task becomes completely meaningless, since every possible set of actions
yields a total return of 0.

\end{solution}
