\begin{exercise}[Exercise 2.1]

In $\epsilon$-greedy action selection, for the case of two actions and $\epsilon = 0.5$, what is the probability that the greedy action is selected?

\end{exercise}

% -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

\begin{solution}

Every once in a while, with probability $\epsilon$, we select randomly from among all the actions with equal probability.
There are two actions in total.
Therefore, the probability that teh greedy (locally optimal) action $a_\text{greedy}$ is selected is

\begin{align*}
    \Pr \Bbraces{A_t = a_\text{greedy}}
    & =
    \Pr \Bbraces{A_t = a_\text{greedy} \mid \text{select greedily at $t$}} \Pr \Bbraces{\text{select greedily at $t$}} \\
    & \quad +
    \Pr \Bbraces{A_t = a_\text{greedy} \mid \text{select uniformally at $t$}} \Pr \Bbraces{\text{select uniformally at $t$}} \\
    & =
    1 \cdot (1 - \epsilon) + \frac{1}{2} \cdot \epsilon \\
    & =
    1 - \frac{\epsilon}{2}.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
