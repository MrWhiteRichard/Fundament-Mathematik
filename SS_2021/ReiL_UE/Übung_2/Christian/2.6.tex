\begin{exercise}
Suppose $\gamma = 0.9$ and the reward sequence is $R_1 = 2$ followed by an infinite sequence of $7$s.
What are $G_1$ and $G_0$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
We use the formula \eqref{eq:2.15} and the geometric series to compute the values:

\begin{align*}
  G_1
  &=
  \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k R_{k+2}
  =
  7 \cdot \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k
  =
  7 \cdot \frac{1}{1/10}
  =
  70 \\
  G_0
  &=
  2 + 7 \cdot \sum_{k=1}^\infty \gamma^k
  =
  2 + 7\cdot \bigg( \sum_{k=0}^\infty \gamma^k - 1\bigg)
  =
  2 + 7 \cdot 9
  =
  65
  \end{align*}
\end{solution}
