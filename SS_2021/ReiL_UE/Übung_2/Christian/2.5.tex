\begin{exercise}
Suppose $\gamma = 0.5$ and the following sequence of rewards is received $R_1 = -1$, $R_2 = 2$, $R_3 = 6$, $R_4 = 3$, and $R_5 = 2$, with $T = 5$.
What are $G_0, G_1 , \dots, G_5$?
Hint:
Work backwards.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
We follow the hint and note that for the terminal state $T = 5$ we defined $G_T = 0$. Now we use the recursive formula

\begin{align*}
  G_t
  =
  R_{t+1} +\gamma G_{t+1}.
\end{align*}

So we end up with

\begin{align*}
  G_5 &= 0 \\
  G_4 &= 2 + 0 = 2 \\
  G_3 &= 3 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot 2 = 4 \\
  G_2 &= 6 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot 4 =  8 \\
  G_1 &= 2 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot 8 = 6 \\
  G_0 &= -1 + \frac{1}{2}\cdot 6 = 2
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
