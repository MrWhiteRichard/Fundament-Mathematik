\begin{exercise}[\textbf{Boxplot and quantiles}]

Two novel randomized algorithms (A and B) are to be compared regarding
their runtimes. Both algorithms were executed $n$ times.
The runtimes (in seconds) are stored in the file \texttt{algorithms.Rdata}.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    \item Set the working directory and load the data using \texttt{load()}.
    Create a boxplot to compare the running times. Color the boxes and
    add proper notations (axes notations, title etc.).

    More info via \texttt{?boxplot}.

    \item Comment on the following statements / questions only using the
    graphic

    \begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
        \item The first quartile of times in A was about?
        \item The interquartile range of the times in B is about trice the interquartile range of A.
        \item Is $n = 100$?
        \item More then half of the running times in B were faster then 3/4 of the running times in A.
        \item At least $50\%$ in A were faster than the 25\% slowest in B.
        \item At least $60\%$ in A were faster then the 25\% slowest in B.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item Regarding the runtimes
    
    \begin{align*}
        23.7, 13.7, 7.6, 9.0, 44.3, 3.5, 1.1, 34.2,
    \end{align*}

    which are a subset of B, find all empirical (a) medians, (b)
    first quartiles and (c) 2/3-quantiles (not using \texttt{R}).
\end{enumerate}

\end{exercise}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(c)] Let's order the runtimes for convenience sake:
    \begin{align*}
        1.1, 3.5, 7.6, 9.0, 13.7, 23.7, 34.2, 44.3.
    \end{align*} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Empirical medians: $[9.0, 13.7]$
        \item Empirical first quartiles: $[3.5, 7.6]$
        \item Empirical 2/3-quantile: $23.7$
    \end{itemize} 
\end{enumerate}

\end{solution}
