# b)

## The first quartile of the times in A was about? -- 20
## the interquartile range of the times in B is about twice the interquartile range of A -- A has IQR ca. 12, B has IQR ca. 24, so yes
## Is n = 100? -- This information is not contained within the boxplots.
## More than half of the running times in B were faster than 3/4 of the running times in A. -- False, it could be exactly 1/2.
## At least 50% in A were faster than the 25% slowest in B. -- True
## At least 60% in A were faster than the 25% slowest in B. -- We can't decide that from the boxplots.
