\begin{exercise}[\textbf{CD players}]

A manufacturer of compact disk (CD) players has established that the
median time to failure for its players is 5250 hours of utilization.
A sample of 20 CDs from a competitor is obtained, and they are continuously
tested until each fails. The 20 failure times range from five hours
(a defective player) to 6575 hours, and 14 of the 20 exceed 5250 hours.
Is there evidence that the median failure time of the competitor differs
from 5250 hours? Use $\alpha = 0.1$. 

\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}

Again we can use the Sign test, where $X \sim_{H_0} \text{Bin}(n, 0.5)$
denotes the number of observation exceeding the median $M_0 := 5250$.
We calculate the

\begin{align*}
    p-\text{value} = \P(X \geq 14) = \sum_{k=14}^{20} \binom{20}{k}\frac{1}{2^{20}}
    \approx 0.05765915,
\end{align*}

which means we reject the null at significance level $\alpha = 0.05$.

\end{solution}
