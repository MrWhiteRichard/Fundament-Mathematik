\begin{exercise}[\textbf{Testing the placebo effect}]

The placebo effect describes the phenomenon of improvement in the condition
of a patient taking a placebo pill that looks and tastes real but contains
no medically active chemicals. Physicians at a clinic in LaJolla, California,
gave what they thought were drugs to 7000 asthma, ulcer and herpes patients.
Although the doctors later learned that the drugs were really placebos,
70\% of the patients reported an improved condition.
Use this to test the placebo effect at the clinic.
