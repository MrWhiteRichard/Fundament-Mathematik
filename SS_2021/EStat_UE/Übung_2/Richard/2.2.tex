\begin{exercise}[Basketball free throws]

Two professional basketball players, Tom and John, each throw ten free throws with a basketball.
Tom makes $80 \%$ of the free throws he tries, while John makes $85 \%$ of the free throws he tries.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]
    
    \item What is the probability that the number of free throws that Tom will make is exactly $7$?
    
    \item What is the probability that the number of free throws that John will make is at least $8$?
    
    \item Player who achives the highest score wins the game.
    It is assumed that the two players do not influence each other when throwing.
    What is the probability that neither Tom or John will win the game?

    \text{Hint:}
    Use \texttt R-function \texttt{dbinom()} to calculate the probability mass functions.

\end{enumerate}

\begin{solution}

Let $X_T$ and $X_J$ denote the number of Tom's resp. John's made throws.

\begin{align*}
    \implies
    X_T \sim b(10, 0.8),
    \quad
    X_J \sim b(10, 0.85)
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]

    \item 

    \begin{align*}
        P(X_T = 7)
        =
        \binom{10}{7} (0.8)^7 (1 - 0.8)^{10 - 7}
        \approx
        0.201326592 \dots
    \end{align*}

    \item 

    \begin{align*}
        P(X_J \geq 8)
        =
        \sum_{x=8}^{10}
            \binom{10}{x} (0.85)^x (1 - 0.85)^{10 - x}
        \approx
        0.82019648 \dots
    \end{align*}

    \item 

    \begin{multline*}
        P(X_T = X_J)
        =
        \sum_{x=0}^{10}
            P(X_T = x, X_J = x)
        =
        \sum_{x=0}^{10}
            P(X_T = x) P(X_J = x) \\
        =
        \sum_{x=0}^{10}
            \binom{10}{x} (0.8)^x (1 - 0.8)^{10 - x}
            \binom{10}{x} (0.85)^x (1 - 0.85)^{10 - x}
        \approx
        0.227620492 \dots
    \end{multline*}

\end{enumerate}

\end{solution}
