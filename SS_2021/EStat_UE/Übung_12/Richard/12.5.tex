\begin{exercise}[Hypnosis]

Some researchers claim that susceptibility to hypnosis can be acquired or improved through training.
To investigate this claim six subjects were rated on a scale of $1$-$20$ according to their initial susceptibility to hypnosis and then given $4$ weeks of training.
Each subject was rated again after the training period. In the ratings below, higher numbers represent greater susceptibility to hypnosis.

\begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{c|c|c}
        \hline
        \text{Subject} & \text{Before} & \text{After} \\
        \hline
        1 & 10 & 18 \\
        2 & 16 & 19 \\
        3 & 7  & 11 \\
        4 & 4  & 3  \\
        5 & 7  & 5  \\
        6 & 2  & 3  \\ \hline
    \end{array}
\end{align*}

Specify and perform the appropriate hypothesis test.
