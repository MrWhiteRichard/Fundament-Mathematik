\begin{exercise}[Missing Information]

An investigation of ethnic differences in reports of pain perception was presented at the annual meeting of the American Psychosomatic Society (Mar. 2001).
A sample of $55$ blacks and $159$ whites participated in the study.
Subjects rated (on a 13-point scale) the intensity and unpleasantness of pain felt when a bag of ice was placed on their foreheads for two minutes.
(Higher ratings correspond to higher pain intensity.)
A summary of the results is provided in the following table.

\begin{align*}
    \begin{array}{l|cc}
                                   & \text{Blacks} & \text{Whites} \\ \hline
        \text{Sample Size}         & 55            & 159           \\
        \text{Mean pain intensity} & 8.2           & 6.9           \\
    \end{array}
\end{align*}

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]

    \item Why is it dangerous to draw a statistical inference from the summarized data?
    Explain.

    \item What values of the missing sample standard deviations would lead you to conclude (at $\alpha = 0.05$) that blacks, on average, have a higher pain intensity rating than whites?

    \item What values of the missing sample standard deviations would lead you to an inconclusive decision (at $\alpha = 0.05$) regarding whether blacks or whites have a higher mean intensity rating?

\end{enumerate}
