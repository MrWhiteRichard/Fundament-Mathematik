\begin{exercise}[\textbf{Hypnosis}]

Some researchers claim that susceptibility to hypnosis can be acquired
or improved through training. To investigate this claim six subjects
were rated on a scale of 1-10 according to their initial susceptibility
to hypnosis and then given 4 weeks of training. Each subjects was rated
again after the training period. In the ratings below, higher numbers
represent greater susceptibility to hypnosis.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    \hline
    Subject & Before & After \\
    \hline
    1 & 10 & 18 \\
    2 & 16 & 19 \\
    3 & 7 & 11 \\
    4 & 4 & 3 \\
    5 & 7 & 5 \\
    6 & 2 & 3 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

Specify and perform the appropriate hypothesis test. What potential issues
exist with this analysis?
