\begin{exercise}[Coin game]

Two players, $A$ and $B$, alternately and independently flip a coin and the first player to obtain a head wins.
Assume player $A$ flips first.
Suppose that $P(\text{head}) = p$, not necessarily $\frac{1}{2}$.
What is the probability that the player $B$ wins?

\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}

The probability that player $B$ wins can be equivalently stated as the probability
that the first head is thrown on an odd turn. Therefore

\begin{align*}
  \P(B \text{ wins}) &= (1-p)p + (1-p)^2p + (1-p)^4p + \cdots \\
  &= (1-p)p\cdot \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}[(1-p)^2]^k = \frac{(1-p)p}{1 - (1-p)^2}
  = \frac{1-p}{2-p}.
\end{align*}

For a fair coin ($p = 1/2$) we obtain

\begin{align*}
  \P(B \text{ wins}) = \frac{1/2}{3/2} = \frac{1}{3}.
\end{align*}

\end{solution}
