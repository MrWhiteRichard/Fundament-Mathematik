\begin{exercise}[Box with coins]

A box contains three coins with a head on each side, two coins with a tail on each side, and four fair coins.

\begin{enumerate}[label = (\alph*)]

    \item One of these nine coins is selected at random and tossed once.
    What is the probability of getting a tail?

    \item If we get a tail, what is the probability that the selected coin has a tail on both side?
    If we get a tail, what is the probability that it is a fair coin?

    \item If the first toss is tail, and another coin is selected at random from the remaining eight coins and tossed once, what is the probability of getting a tail again?

\end{enumerate}
